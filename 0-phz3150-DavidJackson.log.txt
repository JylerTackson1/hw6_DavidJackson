What operating system and version does it run?
	-Windows
How much free disk space does it have?
	-314 GB
What operating systems are you comfortable working in?
	-Windows (advanced)
	-MacOS (Beginner)
What computer classes have you taken, including high school, extracurricular, etc.?
	-CS1, CS2, OOP, C, Python, Web Development, and more... I am taking this course to help me with understanding how to go about working on a research project.
Have you ever programmed a computer?
	-Yes
In what language(s)?
	-Python,C,C++,C#,Java,JavaScript These are probably my most comfortable lanuages.

Summarize your experience:
Have you taken statistics or probability?
	-I have taken stats and am taking AI & Alg for Machine learning which both are heavily involved with probability.
Why are you taking this course?
	-To get a better understandning about going through research and programming for my 2 research projects I am conducting
Are there particular topics you hope to learn?
	-I am particularly interested in particle physics for running simulations however I am interested in learning a deeper understandning of conducting and learning from experiments.
If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly describe your experience:
	-I have done AI modeling, that is the only time I have worked with data and modeling.
	-I am currently working on an autonomous drone project where I am building a model from scratch and collecting data, this is proably the most experience I have had.
Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar? If so, describe:
	-I have been involved with several ENgineering and AI clubs for the past several semesters. I lead clubs and several workshops to put on my resume.

I previously had all dependencies installed from doing work on my project as well as websites such as Kaggle and hackathons. Furthermore I already had Anaconda Installed as I previously have used it and have it being used in my project.
I installed Github Desktop and made an account with UCF nid email
Installed Github desktop from:
https://desktop.github.com/download/

Using my Anaconda prompt, my 3.12.7
Anaconda was already installed to:
C:\Users\Tyler Jackson\Anaconda>

Github Installed to:
C:\Users\Tyler Jackson\GithubDesktop>

I used the snipping tool to take screenshots, that is my preferred way of taking screenshots on windows as I can get a perfect picture of what Im screenshoting.

Beginning HW 2

Noticed yesterday that the homework was due today so I decided that I would do it today... Noticed today that the homework was due at 11:30AM... Big sad.
Anyways we continue the grind, I opened Webcourses to take a look at the assignment.
The frist thing the assignment does is tell me to make a new folder.
I navigate to the same place that HW1 folder is located and create a HW2 folder
	-'C:\Users\Tyler Jackson\01 - SCHOOL\IntroToNumericalComputing'

This is when the instructions mentioned that we will be using the same .log for all logs so I opened the log and made a new submission for today.
In the instruction it says: 
	"In your log, write an original English sentence that has correct syntax but uses incorrect characters, and an original English sentence with incorrect syntax but correct characters.
	 What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages, and why?
	 Answer clearly and in a few sentences, no more."

1) Original English Sentence
	-Bray, how is your banana?	(Bray is my cat, her banana is her toy that is stuffed with catnip she gos crazy for)
2) Original English Sentence, correct syntax yet incorrect characters
	-"Bŗåy, h0w íš yøur bąnãnã?"
3) Original English Sentence, incorrect syntax yet correct characters
	-"Bray, your banana how is?"
What main feature of natural languages that prevents their use as programming languages, why?
	-I believe the main feature of natural languages that prevents their use as programming languages is the lack of a rule set and regulation.
	 In a natural language there are slang terms, legal terms, accents, regional dialects, etc... that all speak differently making it so you must adjust when aqcuianted with these new things.
	 A programming language has one way of understanding the code, being an interpretter or compiler (or two if your java), and this code is structured in a way such that the compiler or interpreter understands.
	

I continued the instructions on the Webcourses Page, I started the Github Start your Journey tutorial on my github student desktop account.
I firstly created a repo with the name 'hello-world'
With the description: "This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."
With a read me file.

I finished the tutorial.
I was very confused because we were initially told to download the desktop version of github and I assumed we were supposed to do that.
However the tutorial shows everything from the online version so I went to that because it was much easier to follow the tutorial.
If I made a mistake I will happily redo it but this is my first time using the online or desktop version of github, I mainly have tried using Git.
I like it as a lot of the things I use through Git are very tedious and Github is very User friendly with a nice UI.


I opened VSCODE and opened the designated spot for the file for the .ipynb to be designated in.
I did the several problems on the webcourses which deal with variable printing, assignment, and manipulation.
I am now copying all this to a markdown cell and turning in the assignment.

Beginning HW 3

HAHA IM AHEAD OF THE CURVE NOW... or im just at the curve turning my work in on time.
Anyways I opened up my webcourses to begin the 3rd assignment.

I began reviewing the assignment and saw that I was going to have to access Github again...
I mean this should have been obvious, we will do this throughout the whole course but anyways, I mention this because I am on my desktop and NOT my laptop which I did my previous assignment on.
NO WORRIES I have everything downloaded and ready.
I sign in and get my github ready.
I get everything synced up and start my assignment...
This is when I see that I need my log so I begin my log around 1:10 PM

I have been working on this homework for about an hour and I am a little over halfway done.
I am now working on uploading the homework to Github so that I can have a saving point.
This homework is covereing creating functions and passing in arguments as well as creating functions in seperate files and importing those functions into our working space.

It is now 3PM I have uploaded all code to the github, I have finished all the requested hw assignments of me in the webcourses and I am now closing my log.
Everything can be seen on my student github connected to my student email.
All changes done can be seen in the folder PHZ-3150 - HW_3

Beginning HW 4

I began the homework in the 3rd floor of CB1.
I downloaded the homework and opened it up in vscode.
I worked with Gio on the homework and had minor diffuculty on it.
Very simple homework that delt with importing a function from a file, creating complex functions and sending and receiving arguments from those functions.

*****IN: Tue Feb 11 6:55 PM EST 2025
I logged in to webcourses and downloaded the file.
I opened the file and did all the questions in the jupytner notebook file.
I am not filling out the log and putting it all in my repo to push to my github
